It was immediately obvious that he would be a fantastic addition to the team, and after he came on board he proved this many times over. His blend of cybersecurity, computer science and AI/ML expertise and the skill and acumen with which he is able to apply this expertise saw him quickly and naturally step into a team lead role, and start contributing valuable insight to important technical discussions and decisions at a level I have rarely seen from somebody joining us straight from a degree programme. Outspoken, insightful, keenly intelligent and with a much sought-after and thoroughly integrated skillset, I am in no doubt whatsoever that Raman has a fantastic career ahead of him.",

      description:
        "Monitoring large crowd gatherings for antisocial activities is required during events like Temple or church festivals, Exhibitions, Public places like Railway stations, Political Meetings etc. It is currently done by the Police or Law & Enforcements authorities with help of technologies like CCTV and nowadays with Drones. However, with the increase in the crowd, and possibilities of more antisocial elements, it becomes almost difficult for humans through native eyes or Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras to monitor manually due to insufficient speed, data and knowledge. The main objective of the paper is to propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning based solution to track antisocial activities in crowded places. The proposed solution is based on an experimental work done for object detection and object movement in a traffic management system and applying new algorithms as modified for crowd management."
